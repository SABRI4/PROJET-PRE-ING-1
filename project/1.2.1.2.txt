Taken by surprise by the carp's attack, you are determined to defend yourself. Despite the difficulty of holding on to the stone after the tail strike, you refuse to back down. You decide to fight the carp with your bare hands.

With fierce determination, you face the aggressive carp. You try to keep your precarious balance on the stone as you prepare your counter-attack. The carp, still moving, shows signs of aggression, leaping out of the water and splashing all around it.

You take advantage of a moment's lull when the carp drops back into the water to move closer, ready to act. You are aware that the carp has considerable strength and power, but you are determined to face this challenge.

As the carp closes in, you grab it firmly by the body, using all your strength to keep it under control. You show tenacity and dexterity as the carp tries to struggle, using your knowledge of fish weaknesses to subdue it. You throw it against a stone with all your might and it loses 20 hit points. The carp fights back, but you manage to dodge its tail. You grab it by the tail and hit it with your weapon with all your strenght, causing it to lose 50 hit points.

Finally, after a bitter struggle, the carp is at the end of its tether. You grab it by the tail and hit it with your weapon, losing 50 hit points.

After this intense episode, you continue on your way, aware of the strength and determination within you. You continue to leap from stone to stone, knowing that you have bravely overcome an unexpected obstacle.

You enter the forest on the other bank, and after a few minutes you find yourself on a path used by traders. Continue along this path and you finally find yourself back in civilisation.
Well done!
