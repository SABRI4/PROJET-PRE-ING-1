You decide to cross the river by jumping from stone to stone. You approach the water's edge and estimate the distance between the stones. 

Carefully, you begin to jump from stone to stone, using your balance and agility to avoid falling into the water. 

The first few jumps go smoothly. You feel confident as you keep moving forward, carefully choosing your next destination. The soothing sound of rushing water accompanies your progress, adding a peaceful ambience to the adventure. 

However, just as you reach the halfway point, you notice bubbles rising to the surface. Intrigued, you lean towards it and see a shadow getting bigger and bigger. 

Suddenly, a huge, aggressive carp emerges from the water and swipes your tail. You struggle to keep your footing on the stone, but you manage. 

What do you do?
