Faced with the immense waterfall before you, you quickly assess your options. Despite the deafening sound of rushing water, you decide to jump in, aligning your body to minimise the risk of injury. 

You take a deep breath to prepare yourself mentally, then jump in with determination. You take care to keep your posture stable and your limbs aligned to reduce the impact of the landing. 

The moment to jump arrives and you propel yourself through the air, letting gravity guide you towards the surface of the water. You feel momentarily suspended, as if time has stopped. 

The contact with the water is extremely powerful, because the large waterfall hid the lack of depth. You jumped 20 metres into 1 metre of water. You died as a result of the shock perhaps you shouldn't have jumped in the first place.
