Taken by surprise by the carp's attack, you feel a rush of adrenaline. Without hesitation, you decide to run away, jumping as quickly as possible on the other stones to get away from the aggressive carp. 

Your reflexes sharpen and you use all your balance and agility skills to propel yourself from stone to stone as quickly as possible. You're determined to avoid any further confrontation with the carp. 

As you move forward, you feel the adrenaline diminish and the situation calm down. You manage to put enough distance between yourself and the carp to feel safe. You slow your rate of jump and catch your breath. 

Finally, you reach the other side of the river safe and sound, with your heart still beating rapidly. You realise that you've escaped a dangerous situation thanks to your responsiveness and your ability to keep your cool. 

You continue on your way, more aware of the possible dangers lurking in these waters. You enter the forest on the other bank, and after a few minutes find yourself on a path used by traders. 

You continue along this path and finally find yourself back in civilisation.
