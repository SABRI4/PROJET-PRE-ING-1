You decide to leave the clearing and return to the path, thinking it best not to linger in this mysterious place. You put the flute back in your bag and get up to continue on your way. 
As you leave the clearing, a strange feeling of regret comes over you. You can't help wondering what might have been had you chosen to stay and explore the magic of this place further. 
You continue to walk along the path, but the landscape gradually seems to lose its magic. The trees become simple trees again, and the whispering of the wind becomes ordinary noise. 
You find yourself once again plunged into the dark and mysterious forest, with no choice but to continue on your way. 
And so the story of the fairy flute ends.
