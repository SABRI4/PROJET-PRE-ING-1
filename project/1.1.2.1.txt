You decide to dig a hole and cover it with leaves, in the hope of trapping the mad cook. With increasing haste, you start digging quickly, using your hands to make the hole deep and wide enough for the cook to fall into.  
Once the hole is ready, you cleverly cover the trap with leaves and twigs to camouflage it. You take up a position near the trap, ready to act at the right moment. 
You hear the mad cook approaching, the sound of his heavy footsteps echoing through the forest. Your heart beats rapidly, mixing fear with excitement at your daring plan. 
Finally, the mad cook appears in front of you, holding his butcher's leaf. He is oblivious, walking unsuspectingly close to the trap you have prepared. 
With a quick movement, you attract his attention by throwing a stone close to him. 
He turns towards the noise, curious to see what's going on. Meanwhile, you jump at the chance and land a blow on his back, sending him tumbling into the trap you've prepared. 
The mad cook falls into the hidden hole, tripping over leaves and twigs. He tries to get up, but is trapped, unable to escape. 
You take the opportunity to make a quick escape towards the forest exit, leaving the trapped mad cook behind. You feel relieved to have managed to escape his threat and to have protected the other stragglers. 
You continue on your way, the exit from the forest drawing nearer, and you're eager to get back to civilisation in safety.
