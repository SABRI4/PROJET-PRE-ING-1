Faced with the immense waterfall before you, you make a wise decision and turn back to the small stone bridge you left behind. 
You turn back cautiously, keeping in mind the deafening sound of the water rushing over the cascade. You walk quickly, away from this dangerous area and back again. 
After a while, you finally find the small stone bridge you had left behind. You feel relieved to find a safer way to cross the river. You cross the bridge carefully, feeling its solidity beneath your feet. 
Once on the other side of the river, you continue on your way, now more aware of the importance of paying attention to your surroundings. You feel safe having taken the decision to turn back rather than risk crossing the waterfall. 
This experience reminds you of the importance of humility in the face of nature and the need to exercise caution in your adventures. You continue to move forward with a new appreciation for the small details and signs of danger that might present themselves to you. 
You enter the forest on the other side, and after a few minutes find yourself on a path used by traders. You continue along this path and finally find yourself back in civilisation.
