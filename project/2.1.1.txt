You decide to explore the clearing. You enter, fascinated by the spectacle before you. The fairy creatures dance gracefully around you, their multicoloured wings shining. 

You are carried away by the music. You dance with the fairy creatures, laughing and twirling to the bewitching rhythm of the melody. A feeling of lightness and magic washes over you, erasing all worries and doubts. 

As you dance, you notice a fairy-like creature that is more imposing and majestic than the others. She seems to be the queen of this enchanted kingdom. She wears a tiara and is able to control the bodies of the other creatures. She approaches you, smiles and hands you a sparkling object. It is a key. The creature points to a door.  

But the door is surrounded by brambles, brambles that seem to be alive because they have the ability to move. You approach the door, the brambles whip at you, you tear them off, your hands become damaged and bleed. You pull again and again, but they have the ability to regenerate thanks to the artefact they have in the middle of their body. You manage to destroy this artefact, then you take the key in your hands and at the sight of this key the brambles move leaving you a hole to enter the key. 

Once you've opened the door, you enter it and a huge blast of wind blows you through. You fly over the forest, see the clearing, the path and the wind carries you to the town gate.
