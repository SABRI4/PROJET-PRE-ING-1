You decide to throw your weapon at the figure with all your might, trying to reveal its true nature or gauge its reaction. The weapon splits the air and heads towards her. 
However, the moment the weapon hit it, it dissipates into a dark mist and immediately forms again, unharmed. The figure turns around. You see a green hat, green boots and a scar on his neck. 
It's the famous mad cook. You become frightened and flee, running with all your might. 
You reach the end of the path, turn round and realise that he's following you with his butcher's leaf. 
You panic, but you can see the way out of the forest. That's when an idea crosses your mind. 
You set a trap for this cook in the hope that he will never again harm strays like you. What kind of trap would you set?
