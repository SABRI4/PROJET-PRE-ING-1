You decide to approach the rock and examine the symbols on it. 
Intrigued by their meaning and their possible link with this mysterious forest, you slowly approach the rock. 
The symbols engraved in the stone seem ancient and mystical. They exude an enigmatic energy that piques your curiosity. 
You observe each detail carefully, trying to find a hidden meaning or clue. 
As you study the symbols, a strange sensation comes over you. You have the impression that the rock is reacting to your presence. 
A faint, pulsating glow emanates from the engravings, as if they are coming to life in response to your attention. 
Suddenly, you hear a rustling behind you. You turn quickly to discover that a half-human, half-animal creature is approaching the rock. 
It stares at you with shining eyes and speaks to you in a language you don't understand, but you can tell by its intonation that it is hostile. 
Judging by her posture, she is about to attack you. 

You do everything you can to reassure the creature, talking to it, humming to it and sitting down. 
The creature doesn't move and looks at you; it seems to smile and understand that you mean it no harm. 
It then approaches you and asks you to caress it. 
You explain your problem, it seems to understand and beckons you to get on its back. Just then, the creature you decide to call "bobby" spreads its wings and flies off with you on its back. 
Bobby then takes you to the other end of the forest and drops you off not far from a small human village. 
Bobby has made a friend, you, but he prefers you to be happy, which is why he says goodbye.
