The bear lunges at you, but thanks to your weapon you manage to fend it off. Get into a fighting position, jump on the bear and hit it on the head, taking 40 points off its life. 

The bear loses to your agility and finds itself on its back in a vulnerable position. You succeed in dealing it a fatal blow and it dies, losing its remaining 60 hit points.

Having successfully killed the bear, you return to where you first encountered it. You see a door. The bear was actually guarding the exit and you didn't fall into his trap.

Congratulations.
