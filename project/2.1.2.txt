You decide to end your melody and leave the enchanted glade, thinking it might be better not to linger too long in this enchanted world. You thank the fairy creatures for their dance and music, feeling slightly nostalgic as you move away from the clearing. You make your way back through the forest, away from the magical atmosphere of the clearing. 
You feel both intrigued and curious to discover what the forest has in store for you. 
As you continue on your way, you come across a strange rock decorated with mystical symbols. It seems to be a point of interest in this part of the forest. Do you want to approach the rock and examine the symbols, or would you prefer to continue on your way without stopping?
