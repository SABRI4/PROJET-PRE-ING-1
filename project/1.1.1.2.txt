You decide to keep your weapon in your hand, wary of the talking bear. You are still confused by this strange situation and don't want to take any risks.

The bear notices your wariness and seems slightly disappointed. He backs away slightly, keeping a safe distance between you. He calmly explains that he means you no harm and is there to help you. 

He mentions that he has extensive knowledge of the forest and can guide you safely back to civilisation.

However, your instinct to be wary gets the better of you and you prefer not to let your guard down. 

You thank the bear politely for his offer, but decline his help. You decide to continue on your own through the forest, keeping your weapon ready at all times. 

That moment arrives much more quickly than you thought, because you hear thuds, birds are stirring, you see trees collapsing under the weight of something very big. It's coming up behind you.

Only a few more trees separate you from the monster, then suddenly the tree just in front of you breaks and the bear reappears as you predicted, it's an enemy.
