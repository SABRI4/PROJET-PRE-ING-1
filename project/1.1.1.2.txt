You decide to keep your weapon in your hand, a feeling of mistrust arises towards the talking bear. 
You are still confused by this strange situation and don't want to take any risks. 
The bear notices your wariness and seems slightly disappointed. He backs away slightly, keeping a safe distance between you. He calmly explains that he means you no harm and is there to help you. He mentions that he has extensive knowledge of the forest and can guide you safely back to civilisation. 
However, your instincts take over and you prefer not to let your guard down. You thank the bear politely for his offer, but decline his help. You decide to continue on your own through the forest, keeping your weapon ready at all times. 
That moment comes much more quickly than you thought, as you hear thumping noises, birds flapping and trees crumbling under the weight of something very heavy. It comes up behind you. 
Suddenly, the tree just in front of you is broken and the bear appears again, just as you predicted: an enemy. The bear lunges at you but you were ready for any kind of attack so you hit it on the head with your weapon and the bear collapses.  
You've managed to kill the bear, so you go back to where you met it. You see a door. The bear was actually guarding the exit and you didn't fall into his trap. Well done!
