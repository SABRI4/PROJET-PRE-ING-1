You decide to climb a tree with your weapon, waiting for the mad cook to pass by. You find a sturdy tree with strong branches and nimbly climb to an elevated position, camouflaging yourself among the foliage.
Your heart races as you wait patiently, ready to act as soon as the mad cook passes beneath the tree. 
You grip your dagger tightly, ready to throw it with precision.
After a few minutes of tense waiting, you hear footsteps approaching. The mad cook is getting closer, his sinister appearance visible through the trees. 
He strides forward, still carrying his butcher's leaf.
The moment is right. The mad cook passes just below the tree where you are perched. You take a deep breath and leap at him.
Your weapon splits the air and hits its target with precision. You hit his shoulder and the mad cook cries out in pain. Off balance, he stumbles and falls to the ground.
You take advantage of his confusion by landing a hit on his chest . You have inflicted 10 points of damage .
