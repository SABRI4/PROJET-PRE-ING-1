The bear pounces on you and strikes a blow, causing you to lose half your life. 
You try to fight off the enemy and shoot an arrow, but it shatters on contact with the bear. Your bow is useless. 
The bear stands on its two hind legs and jumps on you, causing you to lose the rest of your life. You are dead.
